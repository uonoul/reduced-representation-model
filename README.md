Script to model restriction digest of genomic DNA for reduced representation shotgun sequencing

A simple Python script to parse FASTA files based on input restriction enzyme sequences to replicate genomic DNA digest. Additionally, the script graphs the fragment sizes.
Originally utilised on a Cannabis genome assembly, the script could be used on any organism with a completed, publically avaliable genome assembly to predict fragmentation profiles resulting from restriction digest.
